    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Luke Crouse and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I am 
        originally from Franklin, Tennessee and I now live in Eustis, Florida.
        When I moved to Florida in 2022 that is when my life really picked up.
        I decided to go back to school and a friend from work introduced me to 
        programming. I since have fallen in love with programming and have become
        very passionate about it. I ended up changing my major to Computer Programming
        and Analysis and I have been non stop trying to develop my skills as a programmer.<br/>
        Besides programming I also have other interests. I enjoy anything outdoors like
        fishing and hiking. I also love to go to the gym and do weight lifting. 
        Something I have recently begun to enjoy is reading. I like to learn about things 
        and I find that reading books provides more in depth knowledge on whatever 
        subject it was written about.

        That is just a little bit about me and who I am.
