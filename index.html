    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This Resume is a website entirely created by me, Luke Crouse.
        It contains information regarding my education, relevant skills, 
        work experience/internships, and projects.
    </p>

    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>
        I graduated from Summit High School in Spring Hill, Tennessee in 2020.
        After that I went to MTSU for a short period. I am now enrolled
        at Seminole State College in Florida in Computer Programming and Analysis.
    </p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
        I'm still on the newer end of programming but I have gained some
        experience so far. I have learned python, a little bit of java, and 
        am now learning html, css, and javascript. I also am apart of a team 
        that develops games on a platform known as Roblox. So far I have touched
        into some more advanced concepts of programming such as object oriented programming.<br />
        Some soft skills I posses include:
        <ul>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Adaptability</li>
            <li>Problem Solving Capabilities</li>
            <li>Leadership Capabilities</li>
            <li>Attention to Detail</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience and Internships</h2>
    <p>
        I have had a couple jobs in my life so far. One of them was at
        a restauraunt called Sidelines Bar and Grill. I was a dishwasher for them
        for a couple months in High School.<br />
        The job I am currently employed at is with Publix. I am a stock Clerk for them
        and have been with them for nearly three years now.<br />
        As I mentioned before I am on a development team that creates games on Roblox.
        We hope to release a game soon that we've been working on for a bit.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
        Currently I have no noteworthy projects to showcase but am working
        on creating some things to showcase my own skills.
